- 👋 Hi, I’m @SharpAsWedge
- 👀 I’m interested in bringing the best out of me with all my future endeavours regarding project development and other aspects surrounding it.
- 
- 🌱 I have learnt C and C++ as a part of my university course and I will be making a couple of projects with them before I start experimenting with other languages as well.
- 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on various ideas that might be fun and make me think. I love taking on challenges, those that are possible... for the time being.
- 
- 📫 How to reach me:
- Find me on twitter at (coming soon)
